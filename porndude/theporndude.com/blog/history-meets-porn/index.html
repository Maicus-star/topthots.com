				<div class="post-content"><p>We have erotic depictions since <strong>prehistoric times</strong>, if we think of <strong>venus figurines</strong> and <strong>rock art</strong>. Yes, people loved sex since forever and they also liked to express it wide and open. The notion of &#8220;pornography&#8221; as we understand it today was on-air somewhere around the <strong>victorian era</strong>. Like any other product that makes life better, porn was under strange laws in the nineteenth-century. However, the private possession of and viewing of (some forms of) pornography <strong>was not made an offence</strong> until recent times.<span id="more-380"></span> When large-scale excavations of Pompeii were undertaken in the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the Romans came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the Roman Empire. Excavators found hundreds of sexually explicit images, sculptures and frescoes lining the walls of brothels, bathhouses and common households. One of the most famous items recovered was a sculpture of the god Pan having sexual intercourse with a goat. If the act of sex makes people squeamish, bestiality causes a full-on freakout. The piece, along with hundreds of other frescoes and sculptures was originally put on display in the National Archeological Museum of Naples. But after King Francis I of Naples stopped in for a visit, he ordered the explicit material placed in what would eventually be called the Secret Museum. The artifacts remained hidden away for over a century.</p>
<p><strong>Long short, you need to understand that porn in different forms was always here, disregarding the fact that some people wanted to get rid of it.</strong></p>
<p> In the 1800s, the idea of porn for porn&#8217;s sake began to spread. Erotic novels had been in print since at least the mid-1600s in France (though being identified as the author of one meant a sure trip to jail), but the first full-length English-language pornographic novel, &#8220;Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure,&#8221; also known as &#8220;Fanny Hill&#8221; (Oxford University Press) wasn&#8217;t published until 1748.</p>
<p>Despite the reserved public attitudes toward sex at the time, pornographic novels held little back. The author of &#8220;Fanny Hill&#8221; managed to cover bisexuality, voyeurism, group sex and masochism, among other topics. By 1888, the anonymous author of &#8220;My Secret Life&#8221; was writing about sex with words that would make a modern television censor squirm.</p>
<p>Technology drove innovation in the porn genre. In 1839, Louis Daguerre invented the daguerreotype, a primitive form of photography. Almost immediately, pornographers commandeered the new technology. The earliest surviving dirty daguerreotype — described by Slade in a 2006 paper as &#8220;depicting a rather solemn man gingerly inserting his penis into the vagina of an equally solemn and middle-aged woman&#8221; — is dated at 1846.</p>
<p>Video followed a similar path. By 1896, filmmakers in France were delving into the erotic with short, silent clips like &#8220;Le Coucher de la Marie,&#8221; in which an actress performed a strip tease. Hard-core sex started showing up after 1900. These &#8220;stag films&#8221; were usually shown at all-male gatherings, and they were tame by today&#8217;s standards, Slade said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They look like your grandparents having sex,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They were quaint, but it was real intercourse.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Pornography gets popular</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, stag films remained stagnant, both in content and in quality. Then, in the 1970s, changing social mores opened the door for public showing of explicit films. The Internet and the invention of the digital camera lowered the barriers to porn-making so low that entire websites are now devoted solely to non-professional videos.</p>
<p>The shift from publically viewed stag films to privately viewed rentals and internet downloads drove changes in the types of acts shown on-screen. Privacy, Slade said, made men more willing to watch fetish films depicting specific, sometimes odd, sexual behavior. A 1994 Carnegie Mellon study of early porn on computer Bulletin Board Systems (a precursor to the World Wide Web), found that 48 percent of downloads were far outside the sexual mainstream, depicting bestiality, incest and pedophilia. Less than 5 percent of downloads depicted vaginal sex. This could have been because magazines and pornographic films had traditional sex covered, and people went to their computers for images they couldn&#8217;t find elsewhere, Slade suggested.</p>
<p>Today, porn is all over the internet, but the actual size of the industry is a mystery. No one keeps official records, and few studies have made a stab at the economics of porn. Adult Video News, a trade industry journal, made annual estimates of porn sales and rentals, along with sales of magazines and sex toys. In 2007, according to an AVN senior editor Mark Kernes, retail sales reached $6 billion a year. However, AVN&#8217;s figures have been widely disputed. And even if they were reliable, the numbers wouldn&#8217;t take into account all of the free amateur videos uploaded to sites like XTube or the photography site Flickr.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much money is being made, porn is attracting eyes. A 2008 study of 813 American university students found that 87 percent of men and 31 percent of women reported using pornography. The study was published in the Journal of Adolescent Research. And in 2009, University of Montreal researcher Simon Louis Lajeunesse made headlines when he announced that he had attempted a study on the impact of pornography on young men&#8217;s sexuality, but he couldn&#8217;t find a control group. In other words, good luck finding a man in his twenties who hasn&#8217;t seen porn.</p>
<p><strong>What future holds</strong></p>
<p>We already have <a href="../../best-vr-porn-sites.html" target="_blank">VR porn</a>. It is hard to predict what future holds, but seeing the history of adult entertainment, this industry won&#8217;t stop here and it will be as advanced as the military or medicine is.</p>
<p><strong>Controversial content</strong></p>
<p>So what is all that porn doing to us? The question is a hornet&#8217;s nest of controversy. While most mainstream Internet porn today doesn&#8217;t rise to the level of those early Bulletin Board images, critics argue that competition between pornographers has led to an upswing in dominance and verbal abuse of women depicted in films made for straight men.</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to always put out something new, something enticing, to attract people,&#8221; Chyng Sun, a professor of media studies at New York University and director of the film &#8220;The Price of Pleasure: Pornography, Sexuality and Relationships,&#8221; told LiveScience. &#8220;The degradation, the aggression levels, that is something you can create, something a little bit new to offer to the audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>By analyzing best-selling pornography films, Sun has found that physical and verbal aggression are present in 90 percent of mainstream porn scenes. Films directed by women are no less likely to contain aggression than films directed by men, she reported in a 2008 paper in the journal Psychology of Women Quarterly.</p>
<p>Sun argues that these aggressive images are harmful to people&#8217;s sex lives and that they help cement negative stereotypes about women. Others disagree. Prosterman, the San Francisco sexologist, points out that research has failed to draw a clear link between porn and criminal sexual behavior. And, he said, porn is one way for people to explore their own sexual desires.</p>
<p>Debates about pornography have been ongoing since at least the Victorian era (no word on whether stone-age people hid the fertility statues under the mattress), and they&#8217;re not likely to cease anytime soon. Nor are people likely to stop looking at pictures of other naked people. </p>
