				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone pretty much agrees that the world of porn is going towards interactive. There is more virtual reality porn than ever, and with things like choose your own adventure porn that let&#8217;s you be in control, as well as toys that can be controlled over the internet via bluetooth. Now one porn company has put a lot of these elements together to create fully interactive porn movies that will change the way people watch porn forever, which is something that is being said about a lot of new porn technology these days.<span id="more-1199"></span> The company is none other than <a href="https://theporndude.com/566/pornhub">Pornhub</a>, the mega tube site which also offers some premium content. </p>
<p>They have recently announced a partnership with two interactive sex toys. One of them is the Kiiroo Onyx, and the other is the Fleshlight Launch. Both toys are male masturbation sleeves with movements that can be controlled over the internet. The original intent of these toys was to allow a lover who might be traveling from afar, or a cam user who wants to play with their favorite cam performer, to give good orgasms to people. However, Pornhub has found a new use for them. All you have to do is watch one of the videos on the site that are prepared to be compatible with this technology. These videos are coded with the movements that the performers are doing, to make your toy come to life and make your cock feel like you are really experiencing whatever the girl is doing in the film whether it is oral, anal or vaginal.<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Interactive-Category-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1247" /><br />
It&#8217;s a pretty exciting thing that I definitely want to try, don&#8217;t you? This is part of a whole new field of sex toys and porn known as teledildonics. This basically just means interactive sex toys that can be controlled over the internet. The imaginations of the people making these new technologies seems to be endless and it&#8217;s a good thing for the porn biz which had been struggling for a while due to regular porn movies being pirated and made free in many places without the say so of it&#8217;s producers. Free porn is great too, but in order to keep porn companies able to create porn they have to have at least a few guys willing to put down the bucks to make it! Due to large file sizes and other constraints, interactive porn technology is something that people are really interested in and it is something that is hard to pirate, so many people think it will refresh the porn industry overall.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t it sound totally hot and awesome to you? Now I can not only imagine I am getting my dick sucked by Phoenix Marie in a porn movie but I can really feel like she is doing it too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been a story hitting the news lately that is making me chuckle even though it&#8217;s probably not at all funny for the lady that it happened to. Apparently she was having some backdoor fun with a small to medium sized butt plug. Now, this <a href="https://theporndude.com/best-adult-online-shops">toy</a> was safe for backdoor play. It had a flared base to make sure that it didn&#8217;t get sucked up inside of her and lost inside. However, her lover ended up getting a little too excited and he pushed too hard and shoved the whole thing in!<span id="more-1205"></span> When you see the toy you can imagine that would be a little bit painful and in fact, the situation turned out to be so difficult that this lady had to go the ER to get the toy out of her. Her lover was a bit of a jerk and he actually left her there with the toy up her butt because he said he had to work early the next morning (hint: what NOT to do with your date!)<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ass.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1242" /><br />
When she showed up at the hospital, the girl wasn&#8217;t allowed to pass it out the natural way because of the sharp edge of the base. That posed a risk to perforating her delicate insides so she actually had to go under the knife to have it out. The girl&#8217;s name is actually Emily Georgia and she decided to go public with her story because she wanted people to know that they should go to the hospital if they can&#8217;t get something out of their butts. Some people might not go because they are embarrassed or afraid of what the doctor might say, but Emily wants you to know that &#8220;people at A&#038;E [British for ER] see things like this all the time and will have seen far worse things up people’s rectums. The hospital staff were amazing – they were so funny and never once made me feel uncomfortable, that’s why I find it so easy to talk about.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, even if you play with butt toys safely and everything fails, there is always the option of going to the ER to get it out. Most things can be passed naturally, but if it is something sharp and you don&#8217;t want to take the risk, get it out as soon as you can! You&#8217;ll be glad that you did and your booty will thank you. Luckily for Emily she will be able to use her butt again for pleasure sometime soon, but hopefully she ditched the guy who left her high and dry after making a bit of a mistake. Butt stuff can be fun but don&#8217;t just leave someone with something stuck up their butt and go to bed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maitresse Madeline Marlowe is the most expensive cam girl in the world. A guy won an auction by paying $42,000 to spend a coveted hour with her online, and he won it twice. However, he never followed through on his winnings and so he never even cashed in his cam shows! Madeline started low in the industry as a girl who was charging $5.99/minute to watch her live on cam. Now she has men who regularly pay $1,000 per minute to get her to dominate them and tell them what to do!<span id="more-1219"></span> Recently, Maitresse Madeline did an interview where she broke it all down as to how she made it all work and how someone else might be able to do the same.</p>
<p>Her first piece of advice is that you definitely have to take this seriously as a business. If you don&#8217;t you won&#8217;t make it. You have to show up on time, cam when you say you&#8217;re going to be on and be courteous. You also have to get to know them pretty quickly and find out what they want right away.<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sss.jpg" alt="" width="705" height="436" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1237" /><br />
As a dominant, Maitresse Madeline has learned that people always want a piece of her. She says that some people have paid a pretty penny for the contents of her garbage from her bedroom. When she learned that her $42,000 cam client never pulled through, she figured he was probably more of the financial domination type. The act of simply pressing the button to send her the wire transfer of money for the cam show might have been the only thing he needed to get off. She advised her pal Lorelei Lee to do the same thing and lo and behold the same thing happened. </p>
<p>One thing that has kept Madeline sane in this business is that she is also married to a real life pornstar, Will Havoc. She hired him for a porn movie and he had never been in one before. He had everything going for him &#8211; he was a professional ballet dancer as well as a law student. The first time they had sex was not on camera because she was playing the dominant and usually they save that as a privilege. So she took him home and fucked him instead. </p>
<p>Anyways, if you want to become as much of a successful cam performer as Madeline, you will probably have to spend 13 years building up your career and working hard to brand yourself as the top dominant in the business. If you can do that, then maybe you too will have some guy pay you tens of thousands of dollars to not have a fun time with you for an hour on a live cam show!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jenna Jameson is probably the most famous pornstar of all time. At this point she is a household name even though she has retired a long time ago. From 1993 to 2008 she made tons of porn movies, and even founded her own company in the industry. Since 2008 she hasn&#8217;t been doing too much, except for some webcamming here and there, getting pregnant and making headlines for her sometimes controversial statements to the media. Now that she is a bonafide MILF at age 43, she has a lot to say and she&#8217;s not afraid to say it!<span id="more-1203"></span> Jenna was recently commenting on the fact that Playboy is part of the White House press corps &#8211; the publications that are allowed to have journalists attend press events held by the presidential team. This is coming up because the Playboy White House correspondent recently got into a public argument with the deputy press secretary. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/former-pornstar-jenna-jameson-rips-playboy-magazine-after-white-house-confrontation">Jenna had some things to say about this</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well to be honest I’m surprised Playboy is even allowed at the White House&#8230;” Jenna started to explain. “Since they thought it was a good idea to remove the nudity from their failing publication, I have to say they lost their credibility. The fact that they think people actually DO read Playboy for the articles shows they took their finger off the pulse of what people will spend their hard earned money on, a long time ago. Once again, this is a failed attempt by the liberals behind the bunny to drum up a bit of publicity in hops to make us all care again. Have a seat Playboy.” She said, politicizing her statement and letting everyone know where she stands.<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mtmwnzy4ntq5mde4mdg2mde5-92773557.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1230" /><br />
Whatever side you are on, you have to agree that some people do read Playboy for the articles and whether or not the magazine shows full tits and pussy doesn&#8217;t really have much of a bearing on whether people do or do not read the articles. A girl in a bikini or sexy lingerie can be just as alluring as someone who is fully nude for sure! In addition, Jenna must not be up on her Playboy news because it was recently announced that they will be switching back to full nudity this year, and have already had a few issues out with it.</p>
<p>Those who have followed her career know that Jenna is slamming a company that has done her good in the past. She has been in a few Playboy porn movies, and on the cover of many international Playboy magazines, as well as the focus of a few Playboy shoots. Regardless of what Jenna thinks about the company now, her pics and movies with them are still out there for everyone to see and enjoy, thankfully! And anyone on either side of the aisle can be grateful for that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mia Khalifa is a pornstar who decided to leave the industry after making quite a mark by making her entrance from doing a porn movie playing the part of a muslim woman in a <a href="https://theporndude.com/top-arab-porn-tube-sites">hijab</a>. The hot film is one of the most popular out there. Now she is still really popular because first of all, she is really hot. She has 32DD tits, a tiny 26 inch waist and an incredible 40 inch ass. She is also well known for her fiery personality. She is always getting into trouble on social &#8211; or rather &#8211; getting guys in trouble on social media. Celebrity types and professional athletes are always trying to slide into her DMs and she is always shutting them down and then going public with it!<span id="more-1201"></span> She&#8217;s also well known because she is actually Lebanese which is a country full of conservative people. Her fellow Lebanese people have not really appreciated what she has tried to do with her career. She&#8217;s a girl who does what she wants and that&#8217;s why everyone loves her, so the latest reason that she made the headlines shouldn&#8217;t surprise you.</p>
<p>Mia, a notorious sports fan, was at some type of sporting event when a guy saw her and recognized her. He decided to try to snap a selfie of her, with him in the picture, while she didn&#8217;t really know about it. Unfortunately for him Mia noticed and allegedly punched him in the face for taking her photo without her knowledge or permission and she left a bruise! Other Mia Khalifa fans posted to the guy saying that they couldn&#8217;t relate, because other of her fans who have had their pictures taken with her had great experiences &#8211; namely because they asked first. Clearly Mia is big on getting consent and that&#8217;s important.<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Beautiful-Mia-Khalifa-Full-HD-Photo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1222" /><br />
According to a tweet that Mia made to someone else, it may have been that this guy got in front of her and &#8220;shoved a cam in my face&#8221; which is why she felt he deserved some rough treatment. Whatever you think of this, you should know that it&#8217;s not really polite to take pictures of people without their knowledge or no matter who it is, even though the law might say otherwise. You will do much better if you see your favorite pornstar out and about and you ask them if you can take a picture with them because they will like you a whole lot more and they won&#8217;t feel like punching you in the face!</p>
<p>Of course violence is never the answer so if you&#8217;re a pornstar reading this maybe don&#8217;t try punching as your resort to rude guys taking pictures of you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, as you probably know if you read my blog, I love porn. Duh, that&#8217;s a given. I have been really enjoying the <a href="https://theporndude.com/best-vr-porn-sites">virtual reality porn</a> that has been going around these days because the experience is so super immersive. It makes me feel like I am really able to fuck my favorite pornstars, of which I have many. However, I&#8217;ve been watching porn on my regular VR set that I also use to play video games. I didn&#8217;t even know that I need a whole separate VR headset for watching porn, but then I saw that this company called VRotica has come up with a headset that is expressly for that purpose.<span id="more-1197"></span> It kind of makes sense, I guess, but before I read about it even I, probably the number one porn fan in the world, thought it was a little bit ridiculous. At first I was hesitant about this idea, but now that I&#8217;ve learned more about it, I get it a lot more.</p>
<p>The headset is made by a UK startup called Hologram. The thing that makes this headset unique is that you don&#8217;t have to plug it into a computer or anything like that to work which is a major plus for porn, especially if you have a nosy roommate or partner who might be checking your browser history. There&#8217;s always a small chance that you will forget to delete the naughty smut you have been watching! Now the content that will be available on the device will only come from BaDoink which is one of the top VR porn companies on my personal list. There are allegedly going to be over 300 porn movies on the devices but if having porn from only one company is going to be a dealbreaker for you then this is not the device for you. However, in my opinion this company has enough variety in the situations and role play fantasies that they offer that it would be enough for me personally but everyone is different. The headset will come with 6 videos on it, but you will have to buy the rest. The company has already announced plans to add more studios, but this is all they have for now.<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/vrotica.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1211" /><br />
So this headset does solve the problem of having to download porn onto your computer or use your whole bandwidth available to stream smut. But, it does have some downsides in that there&#8217;s only one studio available on it. However, with a pretty affordable price it seems like a good way to make sure that porn stays out of the wrong hands or eyes in your house, and it will give you a truly immersive VR experience that you&#8217;re looking for without the hassle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a sense that Americans like to have a lot of casual sex but the truth is that when compared to some other cultures, there are some surprising statistics that rise to the surface and they might shock you. Some people at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology did <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317766.php">a study </a>that compared Norway&#8217;s sexual habits to those of people in America. They found that people in Norway do have a more open sexual attitude towards things. The whole idea behind the study was that the researchers thought that people in Norway would regret casual sex less than Americans, because they were more liberal.<span id="more-1175"></span> It did turn out that the Norwegians were more liberated in the bedroom because they reported having more one night stands than the Americans, but in all honestly, they did not regret their one night stands much less than Americans. </p>
<p>While more Americans in the study said it was important to live in accordance with their religious beliefs, both religious and non-religious Americans and Norwegians only had a small difference in the level of regret over their one night stands. However, the part where Americans definitely differed was in their love of fantasizing about the people they meet in real life. That probably comes from the fact that the Americans are a bit more sexually repressed so they have weird feelings about asking someone to come home for a shag!<br />

The biggest factor in regret over a one night stand was gender, no matter which country you are from. Women were more likely to regret a night of casual sex, which men were more likely to regret losing out on an opportunity to have casual sex. So it seems that your nationality only matters a little bit in the course of your sexual preferences and how you feel about casual sex. </p>
<p>Unfortunately this study didn&#8217;t explore the cultural or societal reasons for all of these things, but we can certainly imagine them. However, no matter what country you come from you can probably agree that having casual sex or at least fantasizing about it is a whole lot of fun. You can have a one night stand and then forget about it. You don&#8217;t have to do a whole lot of emotional hemming and hawing. You can just have your thing and get your kicks no matter what you&#8217;re into. Watching porn is my way of having casual sex. Of course it&#8217;s even more casual than a one night stand! I just flip to the porn movie I want, then I watch whatever part of it, then I get up and go do whatever else I want!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, what do you know, there are actually quite a few songs about pornography and they are all my favorite. I stumbled across this playlist because I am always scouring the web for anything porn related. No, I don&#8217;t have a problem, I just really love porn! Here are some tunes you should add to your fapping playlist if you&#8217;ve got one. If you don&#8217;t&#8230;start one! Once you do even just hearing any of these songs will get you in the mood.<span id="more-1179"></span></p>
<p>1. Devo&#8217;s Penetration in the Centerfold was a classic rock hit the moment it hit the airwaves. It is all about how back in the 70&#8217;s when the song came out, every month there would be a new men&#8217;s magazine out with a chick spreading her pussy, and even though the guys were tired of the same old thing they would still put out the dough every time to get the goods because they wanted something exciting in their lives.<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/devo.jpg" alt="" width="1224" height="757" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1188" /><br />
2. Van Halen&#8217;s Dirty Movies talks about every guy&#8217;s fantasy. The former popular hottie from back in the day is now a pornstar and what comes along with that. It&#8217;s a great song that will get your rocking and grinding no matter what you are doing.<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/van.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="633" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1191" /><br />
3. Blowfly is a guy who is often looked over in the rap history books, but his song Porno Freak is one that should not be ignored. It is an early rap song that is truly about the joys of watching porn and jerking it off when you feel like doing it. He was really a legendary rap pioneer but unfortunately his work is often overlooked because of it&#8217;s completely adult content and hot porno friendly lyrics.</p>
<p>4. Sarah Silverman is usually a comedian but she wrote a song about porn for one of her shows on TV. It actually shows off her singing chops and it might make you laugh too. It&#8217;s not necessarily about porn per se, but more about people who like to have lots of sex and particularly anal sex.</p>
<p>5. Believe it or not, Elvis Costello&#8217;s song Satellite was partially about porn. It was about all the people watching porn at the same time and seeing someone&#8217;s point of view of sex. The lyrics are quite poetic and highlight the thrills of enjoying porn so much. It&#8217;s a song that is surprising when you find out it is about porn, but if you take a close look at the lyrics you will see that I&#8217;m not making it up.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Pop any of these songs onto your porno watching playlist and see the magic happen. I personally am obsessed with anything porn related so these songs have made me happy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you are doing online dating the winter time might feel like the absolute doldrums. You wonder where have all the babes gone and why are they all hiding? Well, apparently they all come out in the spring and summer time. When that happens certainly depends a lot on where you live. If you live in the southern part of the US then it could come at any time, and in the northern parts it usually happens around June. Regardless of the temperatures around where you live, every part of the US encounters more sun in the summer and less in the winter, making the summers happier for everyone.<span id="more-1177"></span> This is perhaps one thing that explains the findings from a study done by the popular online dating site <a href="https://theblog.okcupid.com/one-night-stand-in-summer-on-the-rise-111291e0675b">OkCupid</a> which lists June as the biggest month for finding hook ups, according to data they have collected on their members. </p>
<p>It all starts in April and even May, when interest in casual sex slowly rises as people do all their spring cleaning and get the cobwebs out of their corners and creases. The increase in sunshine makes people feel super frisky and that is perhaps why by June there is usually around a 17% increase in people looking to hook up! Compared to the rest of the year, June sees 33% more users looking for a quick shag. Some data scientists have some ideas why this might be. First of all, the summer is a time for traveling. College students go on epic backpacking trips across all different countries, people go on vacation and others take on summer projects and internships that take them out of their hometowns and into places where they are only going to be for a few months. Why bother to put down roots if you are not going to be staying for very long? Others surmise that it might have to do with the fact that you always see a whole lot more skin when it is warmer out, which can get those sexual engines revving up for casual sex.<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gty-couple-holding-hands-01-mt-170516_12x5_1600.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="669" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1185" /><br />
If you&#8217;re looking for a relationship, the winter months are better for that, with a 2% increase in the amount of people who say they are looking for a serious sweetie. It&#8217;s probably because in many areas of the US where OKCupid is popular, it gets pretty cold and dismal during the winters and everyone wants to cuddle up to someone cute! </p>
<p>So there you have it. I am all for staying in and watching porn all summer but for those of you who actually want to get out there and date someone or make a quick connection, now might be the best time for you to do so!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.towleroad.com/2017/05/porn-addiction/">Towelroad</a> is a site that focuses on everything gay, but I recently read an interesting article there in my searches for anything about internet porn, and I want to share the details with you. The article details a new sexual orientation called pornosexual, which is people who like to watch porn more than they like to have real sex. I wouldn&#8217;t say that I necessarily fall into this because if I could ever stop watching porn, get out of the basement and into the real world, I would love to get my hands on some hot, fresh pussy, but it&#8217;s hard seeing as I love to spend all of my days reviewing porn for my loyal readers. So, maybe I am pornosexual!<span id="more-1157"></span></p>
<p>Of course this article portrays pornosexual like it is a bad thing, but honestly, I think it is a good thing. First of all, not meeting random strangers for hooking up is a whole lot safer. You don&#8217;t have to worry about encountering weirdos who might not be trustworthy, and you don&#8217;t have to worry about your sexual health either. In addition, as detailed in the article, you don&#8217;t have to put yourself out there. You get to protect your emotions and you don&#8217;t have to be vulnerable at all. Plus, there&#8217;s no fear of rejection, so you can just watch porn until something comes your way that you know is a sure thing! Pornosexuality is different because it&#8217;s the first orientation that is not based on how you are attracted to another human, so some people might say it&#8217;s gender neutral which is quite forward thinking for these days.<br />
<img src="https://theporndude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000315152171.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1172" /><br />
How do you know if you are pornosexual? Well, there are a few ways. If you prefer masturbating to porn over having sex with another person, then you might be pornosexual. If you have a hard time getting your sexual engines started unless porn is involved, you might be pornosexual. If you&#8217;d rather just click your mouse and point your browser towards some porn than go through the horror of finding an online dating site, then you&#8217;re probably pornosexual.</p>
<p>The term pornosexual is a great one. People get to have all sorts of words to describe how they are these days, so why shouldn&#8217;t porn fans get their own? There&#8217;s asexual, demisexual, bisexual, pansexual, heteroflexible, queer, homosexual, and now there is pornosexual! What a great celebration of everyone who loves porn. Don&#8217;t let conservative critics make you feel like your love of porn is a bad thing. Embrace yourself and let your freak flag fly. Sure you probably shouldn&#8217;t tell your parents or boss at work about your newfound sexual identity, but, it&#8217;s great all the same!</p>
